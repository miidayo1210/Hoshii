## Community Module Quickstart

### Creating a Community Organization

1. Navigate to `/community/dashboard`
2. Click "Êñ∞„Åó„ÅÑ„Ç≥„Éü„É•„Éã„ÉÜ„Ç£" to create a new organization
3. Fill in organization details (name, description, theme)
4. Choose organization type (regional, thematic, or group-based)

### Managing Events

1. Go to your organization page (`/community/org/[orgId]`)
2. Click "„Ç§„Éô„É≥„Éà‰ΩúÊàê" to create a new event
3. Select an action package from the global catalog
4. Set event details (title, description, time, place, target star count)
5. Generate QR code for public participation

### Public Participation

1. Share the QR code or direct link (`/community/scan/[publicId]`)
2. Participants can scan and select completed actions
3. Stars are automatically awarded and tracked
4. Progress is visible in real-time on the event page

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/scan` - Record action completions from QR scans
- `GET /api/scan?publicId=[id]` - Get event data for public scanning
- `GET /api/render/constellation?eventId=[id]` - Generate constellation visualization

## Data Layer

The app uses a swappable data layer architecture (`lib/data.ts`). Currently implemented with localStorage, but can be easily swapped for:
- REST API
- GraphQL
- Firebase
- Supabase
- Any other backend

All data operations go through the `DataLayer` interface, making it easy to change the implementation without touching the UI code.

### Community-Specific Data Operations

The community module includes additional server actions in `lib/community-actions.ts`:
- Organization management (create, get)
- Place management (create, get by organization)
- Event management (create, get, get by public ID)
- Action package management
- Scan recording and progress tracking

## Domains

Actions and events are categorized into 5 domains:
- üèÉ **Health** - Physical wellness activities
- üåç **Environment** - Eco-friendly actions
- üë• **Community** - Social engagement
- üìö **Learning** - Educational activities
